# Intensity_Distribution.ijm

A high-throughput macro for ImageJ to segment nuclei in channel 1 and estimate the number of channel 2 foci by measuring the area of signal above a pre-defined threshold. It outputs a plot of number of nuclei and mean number of dots per nucleus against fold channel 1 intensity level above background.
